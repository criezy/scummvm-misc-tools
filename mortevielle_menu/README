This directory contains the C code for two simple programs to decode and encode the menu files for the Mortville Manor
game (MENUAL.MOR and MENUFR.MOR). The decoded version will look like ASCII art. This can be used to change the menu and
was for example used to generate the english version of the menu for our english translation of the game and generate an
improved German menu.
