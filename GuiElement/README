A while back I tried writing a ScummVM theme and was frustrated by the process and in particular the
process of defining the layout. It was getting a lot of errors with without out of screen, or not
appearing where I wanted them to do. This results in having themes with hardcoded width for some
widgets (e.g. buttons) as this is basically the only way to get the layout we want.

I also worked on translating  ScummVM, and there having hardcoded width was an issue since those
had been worked out from the English version of the GUI and it was sometimes difficult to fit
a translated text into the same width (which is particularly frustrating when there is more space
available).

So I started looking at the idea of implementing a more dynamic layout engine. The code you will
find here is an early draft of that thought process. I noever compiled it, let alone test it. This
is C++ code simply because it helped me organized my thoughts. But there is a lot missing to get to
something functional.
