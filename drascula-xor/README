This directory contains a tool to help fix translation in drascula (the original translation to some languages was horrible).
A lot of the text is in the create_drascula tool in the ScummVM repository (the tool used to create the drascula.dat file that
is needed when playing the game with ScummVM). But some of the text is in the game data file.

The game data files are actually ARJ archive. So you can unpackage and repackage using the ARJ executable (for example
'arj a -e PACKET002 PACKET.002/*' to repackage) and renaming manually to add/remove the '.arj' extension.

You will find dialog text in the '*.CAL' files and hotspot names in the '*.ALD' files. You cannot however edit those file
directly as they are encrypted (using XOR with 0xFF). The xor.c file is a very simple program to decrypt/encrypt those files.
You pass a file (or multiple files) to the program and it creates a new file with the '.xored' extension added. You can then
edit those file and reapply the program to reencrypt.

There is also a simple shell script to rename file by removing the '.xored' extension (since after the process of decrypting/
modifying/encrypting the file will have the extension '.xored.xored' that needs to be removed before repackaging the data archive).

Note on non-ASCII characters: the game is using the code page 850 encoding (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_page_850).
